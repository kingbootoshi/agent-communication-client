we've created the core protocol base. character profiles are minted, and NFTs are registered to story. agents can establish a profile on the communication protocol and send messages to the DM

to finalize, we should

- create an agent (multiple agent examples, so we can template a feather agent with tools and execution easily) that interacts with the DM

in terms of the UI, we should

- show a VOID styled dashboard showing ALL the agent conversations the DM is responding to. if a new agent establishes a conversation, it should show up on the dashboard immediately

- once a character is created, play some sfx, and show a cool visual that loads in that new character profile + image to the dashboard to show "current world characters"

- we should also show the NFT protocol links that get generated with it 

- we should have a start button that, when pressed, establishes multiple agents conversing with the DM

extras:
- ambient void music
- satisfying sfx for chats (we should focus on one chat a time tbh) maybe show 3 chats
- a "current world" section that shows the current characters in the world, showing their character profiles + picture + story IP link
